## The Story

Development of the Spark Core in its current form began in January 2013 in Shenzhen, China during Spark's participation in the HAXLR8R hardware accelerator.  Development of the Spark Cloud was started in December 2011 as software infrastructure to support the Spark Socket.  Between January and May of 2013, the Spark Core and Cloud were developed from prototypes to a functional platform for building internet-connected hardware.  On May 2, 2013, the Spark Core was launched on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.  On May 17, 2013, the hardware design files for the product were released here on GitHub for others to use and learn from.

## What's Included

**BOM** — Current bill of materials for the most updated version of the Spark Core.  Includes part number labels from design files, component values, quantities, and package types.

**Datasheets** — Datasheets for the STM32F103 microcontroller and CC3000 Wi-Fi module.

**EAGLE** — Schematic and board files for the Spark Core.  We use EAGLE, a free PCB design software package, for the design and development of the Spark Core.

**Gerber** — Complete set of Gerber files for the current version of the Core.  Use these files to spin up and assemble your own Cores!

**Libraries** — EAGLE libraries for the components used on the Spark Core

**PDFs** — Includes detailed description of component placement on the Core (especially useful during assembly).  Also includes mechanical drawings and a detailed schematic of the Core for reference and debugging.

**Pin Mapping** — Detailed pin mapping of the Spark Core and STM32, providing information about which pins are mapped to which peripherals.
